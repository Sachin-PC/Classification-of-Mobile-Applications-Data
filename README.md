# Classification-of-Mobile-Applications-Data

This code extracts the features from a pcap file which consists of the mobile application data. The pcap file is obtained by capturing the mobile data using tpacketCapture pro.

Steps to capture the data using tpacketCapture pro:

1. Install the application in your mobile device.
2. Specify the application you want to capture the data from using
“Filter App List” option.
3. Start Capturing the data.
4. Once you have sufficient data, just stop the capture.

The captured data is stored in a pcap file and we can visualize the
capture data using Wireshark.
